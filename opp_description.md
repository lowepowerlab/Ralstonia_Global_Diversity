# RSSCdb, a database for tracking the global spread of Ralstonia solanacearum sequevars and strains 

### Tag: DATABASES

A database of characterized strains of Ralstonia solanacearum species complex strains whose data have extracted from the peer-reviewed articles that include the geographic, host of origin, year, and phylogenetic classification (phylotype/sequevar).

## Background

Bacterial wilt pathogens in the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ species complex (RSSC) are destructive pathogens, especially in tropical and sub-tropical climates with year-round precipitation. Most strains in this species complex are soil-borne pathogens that cause persistant infestations once introduced. Tomato, potato, tobacco, banana, ginger, and peanut are crops that are well-recognized hosts of _Ralstonia_. In 2005, Mark Fegan and Philippe Prior formalized a DNA-based taxonomy for the RSSC called a "phylotype-sequevar" system. Since their publication, hundreds of plant pathologists around the world have classified the population diversity of the RSSC on specific crops or in geographic regions. 

## What is the database for?
RSSCdb is a database of characterized strains of Ralstonia solanacearum species complex strains whose data have extracted from the peer-reviewed articles that include the geographic, host of origin, year, and phylogenetic classification (phylotype/sequevar). This strain metadata is available in the main text or supplemental material of the publication. The project was developed to provide UC Davis undergraduate researchers with a remote research experience. The data will be supplemental material for a systematic review article to be submitted for publication after data collection is finalized (Lowe-Power et al. unpublished). In the interim, the data is released on BioRxiv and GitHub after UC Davis students complete their thesis (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.189936v1).

## How is it developed?
The database is organized in an Excel spreadsheet, a format that facilitates regular curation of data entry. 

## Whatâ€™s next?
Emerson M. Del Ponte will advise a student on creating an interactive dashboard to view the data, similar to his FGSCdb for tracking species and chemotypes of the Fusarium graminearum species complex: https://fgsc.netlify.app/

We would like to extend the utility of the Ralstonia diversity project by allowing other researches to contribute raw data to populate the global map. Get in touch (tlowepower@ucdavis.edu) to receive instructions on how to submit your data.
